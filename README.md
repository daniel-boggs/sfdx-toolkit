# SFDX Toolkit

A soon to be growing collection of Apex utilities and Lightning Web Component examples.


### Note
This project isn't tied to any org - it's just a public toolkit of code I find useful in Salesforce development.

I'll keep this fresh as come up with new things worth adding.

### Updates
**Oct 2025**
- Initial structure added
- Added `Logger` class and test
